'''This script finds all references to the string decode function (manuallyspecified). The string provided as an argument to this function is then decodedand it's decoded value is then added as a comment. Additionally, the DWORDstoring the decoded function is renamed accordingly.Example:	Found XREF: 401d11	[*] Found encrypted string: jvavarg [0x401d0c] | Decoded: wininet	Found XREF: 401d29	[*] Found encrypted string: xreary32 [0x401d22] | Decoded: kernel32	Found XREF: 401d4b	[*] Found encrypted string: VagreargBcraN [0x401d46] | Decoded: InternetOpenA	Found XREF: 401d67	[*] Found encrypted string: VagreargBcraHeyN [0x401d5d] | Decoded: InternetOpenUrlA	Found XREF: 401d7d	[*] Found encrypted string: VagreargErnqSvyr [0x401d73] | Decoded: InternetReadFile	** Truncated **Author = Josh Grunzweig [Unit42]Copyright = 'Copyright 2014, Palo Alto Networks''''def decode(str):	out = ""	for x in str:		o = ord(x)		if o <= 109 and x.isalpha() and x.islower():			out += chr(o+13)		elif o <= 77 and x.isalpha() and x.isupper():			out += chr(o+13)		elif o >= 110 and x.isalpha() and x.islower():			out += chr(o-13)		elif o >= 78 and x.isalpha() and x.isupper():			out += chr(o-13)		else:			out += x	return out# Find all references to the string decode function.
